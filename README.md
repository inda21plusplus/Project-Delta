# Project-Delta
This is the repository for the group project assignment in the course "Project in Introduction to Computer Science" (DD1396), by the Inda21plusplus group.

## How the development process will look
### The plan
The plan is to have a clean and structured approach to development in order to make everyones lives easier. 
### Merging requirements
To be able to merge into main (ex master) you have to create a branch do your work an then push the branch upstream and create a Pull Request. To keep track of what everyone is doing we will also base our work on issues where you create an issue (Add gravity to physics component, for example) with respective lables (Enhancement and Game Engine fits this issue). In order to be able to merge the code into the main branch the PR has to be able to merge (of course), pass the workflow test (cargo check, -test, -build, -clippy) and pass reviews from two other project members. Code reviews will ensure we keep our code efficient, readable, and clean. Merging directly into the main branch will not work, You can of course make local changes in main branch but you will not be able to push them.
### Git commits
Try to keep git commits small and concise. This makes following commits and progress easier in adition to making pull requests easier to review.
### Documentation
We should try to document as much code as possible to make it easier for others to understand the code and make it easy to circle back to.
### This is just an idea
This is just preliminary and can of course change.
